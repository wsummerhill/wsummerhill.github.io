I work as a senior red team consultant specializing in penetration testing, red teaming, and purple teaming engagements. I'm deeply interested in malware development and all things malware evasion! <br>
I've also presented at various conferences such as SecTor (Toronto) and NorthSec (Montreal). See [this page](https://wsummerhill.github.io/presentations/).
