I work as a red team consultant at Mandiant specializing in penetration testing and red teaming engagements. I'm deeply interested in malware development and all things payload/malware execution. <br>

My interests include:
- Malware development - C#, C++
- Active Directory exploitation
- Research new tooling and techniques
- Teaching and helping others
