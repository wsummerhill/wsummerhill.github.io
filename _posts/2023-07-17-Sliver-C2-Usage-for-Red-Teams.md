**Scenario:** You're on a red team engagement and want to execute .NET utilites in your Beacon but need to increase your chances at evasion and opsec. You obviously can't touch `execute-assembly` or similar utilities. You tried BOF.NET but sometimes the Beacon gets killed, or maybe you're hesitant to try BOF.NET at all (I've been there).
