**Scenario:** You're on a red team engagement and want to execute .NET utilites in your Beacon but need to increase your chances at evasion and opsec. You obviously can't touch `execute-assembly` or similar utilities. You tried BOF.NET but sometimes the Beacon gets killed, or maybe you're hesitant to try BOF.NET at all (I've been there).
<br />

Instead, why not proxy your .NET tools through a SOCKS proxy using [**Proxifier**](https://www.proxifier.com/) on Windows? There are many required configurations for Proxifier and it doesn't always work as expected in my experience, or its not always clear unless you dive into documentation. So I wanted to make a single point of reference on how to properly proxy .NET tools through Proxifier from a Windows host.
<br />

### Here are the steps required to configure Proxifier on your Windows system:

1. Open Proxifier. Go to `Profile -> Advanced -> Services and Other users` -> Check the button "**Windows services and other system processes**" and hit OK<br />

2. Go to `Profile -> Name resolution` -> Check the button "**Resolve hostnames through proxy**" and enter in your domain names you want to resolve through Proxifier<br />

3. Go to `Profile -> Proxy servers -> Add...` -> Add a new proxy server with your proxy host/port -> Click `Advanced...` -> Check "**Use target hostname in proxy request if available**" <br />

4. Next, go to `Profile -> Proxification Rules...` -> Add a new rule that captures ALL (_Any_) traffic sent to your target IPs/hostnames by adding them to the rule. I add a rule for both IP addresses and hostnaems since DNS resolution doesn't always work for me. For `Action`, select your configured SOCKS proxy server.<br />

  a) Adding a new rule to capture ALL traffic for your target IPs:<br />

  b) Both IP and hostnames rules added and assigned to your SOCKS proxy:<br />

5. Start **cmd.exe** or **powershell.exe** as your domain user: `runas /netonly /user:domain.com\user powershell.exe (enter password)`<br />


6. Then use any .NET **Sharp**** tools or any other command-ine tools in the new cmd/powershell window through your proxy! If it's working properly you will see the tool's executable name populate in the Proxifier window: <br />

And that's it!
