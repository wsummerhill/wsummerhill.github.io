## DLL side-loading

I'm going to cover an example of how to perform a DLL side-load from start to finish using a C++ payload and legitimate DLL commonly found on disk. 

In this post I'll walk through how to choose an EXE and DLL to side-load, how to find the exported functions needed to side-load the DLL,
how to create the malicous DLL, and then to execute everything together for a successful side-load attack.

But first...

### What is DLL side-loading?

(Source: MITRE)[https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/]
_"Side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads. 
But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries may 
directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s)."_
