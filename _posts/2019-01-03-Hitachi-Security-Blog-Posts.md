In 2018 I started doing some freelance writing for Hitachi security systems. The posts focused on introductory penetration 
testing and vulnerability assessment concepts and were more geared towards executives and C-level members. I had a fun time 
coming up with interesting ideas around my previous work experiences and actually writing it down in a user-friendly and 
general format for people of all backgrounds to understand.
